# Washing Machine Notification System - Progress

## Project Overview
Building a washing machine notification system using an old Android phone as a sensor, Node.js backend, and React web dashboard.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Firebase configuration
- [x] Android app basic structure
- [x] Audio detection service implementation
- [x] FFT-based frequency analysis
- [x] Reference sound analysis and sequence matching
- [x] Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
- [x] Foreground service for continuous audio monitoring

### 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Sound calibration and tuning
- [ ] Backend server implementation
- [ ] Web dashboard development
- [ ] Notification system integration

### ⏳ Pending
- [ ] Testing with actual washing machine
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Documentation

## Recent Updates

### 2025-07-11 - Audio Detection Improvements
- **Issue**: Frequency mismatch between reference and live audio analysis
- **Problem**: Live audio detecting ~3700 Hz while reference shows ~1000 Hz frequencies
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed FFT window size consistency (2048 samples for both reference and live)
  - Added improved frequency filtering (threshold-based noise reduction)
  - Implemented fallback FFT using Apache Commons Math
  - Added JitPack repository for JTransform library
- **Status**: Ready for testing, needs calibration with actual washing machine sound

### Technical Details
- **Sample Rate**: 44100 Hz (consistent between reference and live)
- **FFT Window Size**: 2048 samples
- **Step Size**: 1024 samples (50% overlap)
- **Frequency Filtering**: >50 Hz, <20 kHz, >10% of max magnitude
- **Detection Parameters**: 70% window match, 4+ frequency matches per window

## Next Steps
1. **Sound Calibration**: Test with actual washing machine completion sound
2. **Backend Development**: Implement Node.js server for notification handling
3. **Web Dashboard**: Create React interface for monitoring and configuration
4. **Integration**: Connect all components for end-to-end testing

## Notes
- Android app is functional but needs real-world testing
- FFT analysis is working but may need parameter tuning
- Firebase integration is ready for notifications
- Need to record actual washing machine completion sound for reference
